<div property="content:encoded"><p>Masters champ <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/sergio-garcia.htm">Sergio Garcia</a> and TaylorMade have "mutually agreed" on a contract release that ends a 15-year relationship and makes the Spaniard a hot commodity on the equipment free agent market.</p><p>Garcia signed with TaylorMade as a 22-year-old back in 2002, and he had their clubs in the bag this spring when he beat <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/justin-rose.htm">Justin Rose</a> in a playoff at the Masters for his first major title. But the relationship will not extend any further according to a release from TaylorMade on Monday.</p><p>"Today, after a memorable 15-year partnership with Sergio Garcia, we have mutually agreed on a release from the remaining years of his TaylorMade contract," the statement read. "It has been an honor to play a role in his performance throughout his career, including <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/the-players-championship.htm">The Players Championship</a>, 19 worldwide wins, <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/ryder-cup.htm">Ryder Cup</a> heroics and his 2017 Masters win. We congratulate Sergio on a career year and wish him all the best in the future."</p><p>The announcement comes five days after parent company Adidas announced that it had <a href="https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2017/adidas-completes-divestiture-taylormade-adams-golf-and-ashworth/" target="_blank">completed its divestiture</a> of TaylorMade, Adams Golf and Ashworth brands to KPS Capital Partners.</p><p>Where Garcia goes from here remains to be seen, but Callaway may be the front-runner to land his services. Garcia <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanrwall/status/913516380154085376" target="_blank">was photographed</a> experimenting with Callaway wedges at the British Masters in his most recent start, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanrwall/status/903748080654266368" target="_blank">he used</a> a Callaway-owned Toulon putter during the <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/dell-technologies-championship.htm">Dell Technologies Championship</a> last month.</p><p>TaylorMade's remaining player stable includes world No. 1 <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/dustin-johnson.htm">Dustin Johnson</a>, world No. 5 <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/jon-rahm.htm">Jon Rahm</a> as well as former world No. 1s <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/rory-mcilroy.htm">Rory McIlroy</a>, <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/jason-day.htm">Jason Day</a> and <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/people/tiger-woods.htm">Tiger Woods</a>.</p></div>
