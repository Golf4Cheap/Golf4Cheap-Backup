It left him at 12 under for the week, one shot ahead of Luiten in what turned into a two-man race down the stretch.</p><p>The victory carries extra significance for Garcia, whose charitable foundation serves as tournament host for this week's event. It also marks the first time in his nearly two-decade career that he has won three times in a single season, having also captured the Omega <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/dubai-desert-classic.htm">Dubai Desert Classic</a> in February.</p><p>Garcia the day with a one-shot lead over Daniel Brooks, who ended up alone in third place. The Spaniard took control of things with three straight birdies on Nos. 9-11, adding a birdie on the par-5 17th to remain just in front of Luiten, who was in search of his first win since last year's <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/klm-open.htm">KLM Open</a>. Garcia's previous best result since winning the Masters was a T-2 finish at the <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/bmw-international-open.htm">BMW International Open</a> in June.</p><p>This was the first time the Andalucia Masters was conducted since 2011, when Garcia also captured the trophy. He had served as tournament host last year for <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/topics/events/british-open-championship.htm">the Open</a> de Espana, which was also held at Valderrama and won by Andrew "Beef" Johnston.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Gray, a staff writer, covers events and is the lead host on Golf Channel's podcast.</p></div><div><p><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.golfchannel.com/sites/golfchannel.prod.acquia-sites.com/files/styles/gfc_author_bio_118x98/public/2016/01/11/will-grey-472x392.jpg?itok=_e0fnEpO" width="236" height="196"></p></div></div><div><h2>Editor's Picks</h2><h5>Presented by Penske</h5><p><img src="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackimp/N124603.124614THEGOLFCHANNEL0/B11007674.150167112;dc_trk_aid=320912350;dc_trk_cid=81280460;ord=%5Btimestamp%5D;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=?" alt="Advertisement" width="1" border="0" height="1"></p></div></div></div></div>
