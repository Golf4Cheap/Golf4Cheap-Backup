<div><div><p>Jorge Fernandez-Valdes might want to try a different snack when he makes the turn on Friday.</p><p>The Argentinian pro's opening round at the Lexus Peru Open was truly a tale of two nines. The 25-year-old got off to a sizzling start to the PGA tour Latinoamerica event, birdieing eight of his first nine holes to post a ridiculous front-nine score of 8-under, 28--but then things changed.</p><p>Fernandez-Valdes' back nine began quietly; he made five pars in a row. Bogeys on 15 and 17 tarnished&nbsp;Fernandez-Valdes' scorecard, but he still sat near the lead before running into disaster on the 18th hole, where he finished with a quadruple-bogey 8.</p><p>As you can see in the scorecard below, that balanced out to an unforgettable round of 28-42 for a 70, putting the 25-year-old Argentinian at 2 under par and in a tie for 38th.</p><blockquote data-lang="en">â€” Tron Carter (@TronCarterNLU) <a href="https://twitter.com/TronCarterNLU/status/921201554455134214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2017</a></blockquote><div><div><div><p></p></div></div><div><p>This is how a golf ball is made</p><p>A behind the scenes tour of the&nbsp;Titleist&nbsp;factory, where longtime employees talk about the art and science of making the perfect ball. </p></div></div></div></div>
